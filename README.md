# Functional Alarm Clock

This is a fun and functional alarm clock web application that not only wakes you up with an alarm sound but also makes you play a quick game to turn it off. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it includes sounds and visual effects to make the experience engaging.

## Features

- **Animated Background:** A colorful, gradient background with smooth transitions.
- **Real-Time Clock:** Displays the current time, updated every second.
- **Set an Alarm:** Allows users to set a time for the alarm to go off.
- **Interactive Game:** To turn off the alarm, users must catch a moving button.
- **Celebration Effect:** Once the alarm is successfully turned off, a fun confetti animation and celebration sound play.
- **Secret Code:** For those who know the secret, typing `rr` will immediately stop the alarm.

## How to Use

1. Set the desired time for the alarm by selecting a time from the input field.
2. Click the "Set Alarm" button. The alarm will be scheduled for the specified time.
3. When the alarm goes off, a game screen will appear where you need to catch a moving button to stop the alarm.
4. Once you catch the button, the alarm stops, and a celebration animation plays.
5. Alternatively, you can stop the alarm by typing the secret code `rr` during the game.
